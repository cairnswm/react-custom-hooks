# react-custom-hooks

These are cusotm hooks that I have created and used in various projects. They are not wrapped as a library, instead just copy the ones you need into your own projects and use them as needed

## src/data

These hooks are used to build data related hooks. They can be composed into a single hook that adds filtering, sorting and pagination as needed

TODO: Add hooks for POST, PUT, Delete that can also be composed into the main hook
